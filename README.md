BATTLESHIP GAME IN JAVA (incomplete)

A Battleship game against a computer opponent. User interface allows user to choose ship positions while opponent's ships are randomly chosen. User clicks on enemy board and system updates for hits and misses and identifies when ships have been sunk and when the game is over. 

REQUIREMENTS

Java 8.0
JavaFX 
IDE (I used Eclipse)

NOTES

This game has been developed as I've learned more about Java and before learning about Git and versioning. The game is still incomplete and is a work in progress.
